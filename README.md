- Hey I'm Durgesh! Nice to meet you!
- I love diving into HTML5, CSS, Python, JavaScript, Java, and Ethical Hacking.
- Python and SQL Injection sound to me like exciting areas to explore.
Count me in if you ever want to chat about coding or collaborate on projects involving different languages!
 Feel free to drop me a message on Gmail at smss4718durgesh@smshettyinstitute.org.
- I'm looking forward to talking with you! ðŸ˜„
